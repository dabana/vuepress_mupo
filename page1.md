## A brief introduction

Hi my name is David Banville. I own a bachelor in engineering physics for École Polytechnique de Montréal. I keep reading about recent advances in astrophysics and particle physics. We live in a very exiting era. We are so close to answering foundamental questions about our origins, it gives goosebumps. I also revisit the work of the founders of this discipline from time to time. Physics thought me to question everything and to think from first principles. These thought processes are especially usefull to switch disciplines, which is what I am doing right now.
