# Introducing the MuPo

Name it MuPo, Mupot, Musical-Pot, Micro-Pot or Musical-Potentiometers, MuPo is at The Crossroads of music and potentiometers. It extends the BBC microbit with two fondamental features: a) an audio-jack and a buzzer, b) continuous rather then boolean inputs. A nice though-of design.

## Continuous inputs for your projects

The MuPo interfaces with the BBC Microbit through 5 threaded stand-off that are soldered to the bottom side of the board. Also on the bottom side, MuPo has two thumb wheel potentiometers. Potentiometers are variable resistors that can be used to control voltage. It the case of the MuPo, the voltage from the 3V pin of the BBC Microbit can be varied from 0 to 3V by turning the thumb wheel of one of the potentiometers. This variable voltage is fed to one of the input pins of the BBC Microbit (pin 1 and 2). With the MuPo, the BBC Microbit can now read continous inputs from the user through these potentiometers and the analog read function. With the two bottons already available on the Microbit, you can now enhance the user experience in your projects and create some cool games such as [Tetris](page3.md)!

## Musical projects

Despite the two potentiometers, their is a barrel audio jack connector on the bottom side. With the audio jack, you can now create musical projects without disturbing other people by plugging your head phones to the MuPo. Once your are done, you can now discturb a lot of people by hooking-up your Microbit to a really loud sound system using a standard auxiliary cable. If you feel the sound is to loud, you can lower the sound level using the volume potentiometers located on the top-side. If you do not have head-phones or a big audio system, you can show case your musical projects using the on-board piezo-electric buzzer soldered to the top-side of the MuPo. You can choose between the audio jack or the buzzer by fliping right control switch to the "buzzer" or the "jack" position. 

## Portable projects

Also on the top side, the MuPo has a coin cell battery holder so you can carry your microbit around to show your projects to your friends. Once your are done tinkering with your microbit, do not forget to turn the power switch off to save battery life.
