# Introducing the MuPo

Name it MuPo, Mupot, musical-pot, micro-pot or musical-potentiometers, MuPo is at The Crossroads of music and potentiometers. It extends the BBC microbit with two fondamental features: a) an audio-jack and a buzzer, b) continuous rather then boolean inputs. A nice though-of design.
